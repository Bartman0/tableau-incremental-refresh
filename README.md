# tableau-incremental-refresh
Project that enables you to perform realistic incremental refreshes in a Tableau Server environment with databases as source system. It uses the Tableau Hyper and Server Client API's to accomplish this. And a [modified/forked Tableau document API](https://github.com/Bartman0/document-api-python/tree/extract).

Of course, more documentation is needed to get this functionality implemented in your situation. That will follow later when this component is fully developed and tested more rigorously.
